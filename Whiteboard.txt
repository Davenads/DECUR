DECUR: Baseline Build Priorities
1. HOME (Simplified)
* Clean landing page with DECUR logo and mission statement
* Brief introduction to Dan Burisch's work
* Basic navigation to other sections
2. DATA (Core Focus)
Streamlined Structure:
* Focus on organizing the most well-documented aspects of Burisch's research
* Initial categories:
   1. Extraterrestrial Entities - Basic profiles of P-45s, P-52s, and Orions
   2. Timeline Mechanics - Fundamental concepts of Timeline 1 vs Timeline 2
   3. Project Lotus - Core findings and basic explanations
Visualization:
* Start with static diagrams rather than interactive tools
* Simple timeline graphics
* Basic relationship charts
3. RESOURCES
* Curated list of primary Dan Burisch materials
* Organized transcript repository
* Basic glossary of terms
4. ABOUT/CONTACT
* Simple contact form
* Platform purpose statement
* Basic information about the project
Technical Foundation:
* Mobile-responsive design
* Basic user authentication
* Simple search functionality
* Content management system for easy updates
Elements to Defer:
* Community features (forums, collaboration tools)
* Advanced visualization tools
* Methodologies section (can be added as the platform matures)
* Donation infrastructure (add once user base is established)
This baseline approach focuses on properly organizing and presenting the core Burisch material first, creating a solid foundation that can be expanded incrementally. The primary goal should be to make the information accessible and well-structured before adding interactive or community features.
